    "description": "Become the Nightmare. Master the dream. Shatter reality.\n\nShape of Dreams is a fast-paced action roguelite that fuses hack-and-slash combat, MOBA-style teamplay, and endless strategic variety. Journey through surreal dreamscapes where every battle tests your reflexes and every choice shapes your fate. Play solo for a tight, skill-based challenge or team up with up to three friends in real-time co-op, improvising distinct combat styles and forging powerful builds that can turn you into the nightmare your enemies fear.\n\nHere, the dream bends to those strong enough to shape it. Wield an ever-changing arsenal of skills, modifiers, and artifacts to craft devastating combinations, break through impossible challenges, and carve your own path of progression. No two runs are ever the same, and no single \"meta\" will carry you to victory.",
